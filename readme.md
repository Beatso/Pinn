# Pinn

With this bot, anyone can get a message to be pinned, on any channel that they have add reactions permission to, and the bot has manage messages permission.

To pin a message, react to that message with :pushpin:. To unpin it, react with :no_entry_sign:. Note the bot can only unpin messages that it has pinned.

Because anyone can pin messages, this bot is only recommended for private discord servers and with people that you trust.  
If you would not like the bot to work on announcement channels etc., remove the permission Manage Messages from that channel.
